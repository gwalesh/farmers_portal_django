# 🌾 Smart Agri AI - Crop & Residue Detection with Market Insights

This project uses Artificial Intelligence to revolutionize modern agriculture by detecting crops and residue from images and recommending the best market to sell them. Leveraging the power of **Meta's LLaMA 2**, an open-source large language model, our system provides intelligent, real-time insights for farmers and agri-businesses.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌱 **AI-powered Crop Detection**: Upload an image and get accurate identification of the crop type using computer vision models.
- 🍂 **Residue Detection & Categorization**: Identify leftover agricultural biomass (e.g., stems, husks) and classify them.
- 📍 **Best Market Suggestions**: Based on the crop or residue type and current market trends, receive suggestions on where to sell for the best value.
- 🔄 **Integration with Marketplace APIs**: Connects with real-time market APIs or databases for live price suggestions and demand predictions.
- 🧠 **Powered by LLaMA 2**: Uses LLaMA 2 to generate smart, natural-language insights and recommendations.

## 🧠 Technology Stack

- **AI/ML Models**:
  - Image classification model (custom-trained)
  - LLaMA 2 (language-based recommendation engine)
- **Backend**: Python / FastAPI / Flask
- **Frontend**: React / Vue / Blade (customizable UI options)
